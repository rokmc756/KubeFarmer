                              Version 2, June 1991

        Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
        51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
        Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
        of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                                   Preamble

         The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
       freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
       License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
       software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
       General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
       Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
       using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
       the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
       your programs, too.

         When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
       price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
       have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
       this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
       if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
       in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

         To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
       anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
       These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
       distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

         For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
       gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
       you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
       source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
       rights.

         We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
       (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
       distribute and/or modify the software.

         Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
       that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
       software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
       want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
       that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
       authors' reputations.

         Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
       patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
       program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
       program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
       patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

         The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
       modification follow.

                           GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
          TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

         0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
       a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
       under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
       refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
       means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
       that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
       either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
       language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
       the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

       Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
       covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
       running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
       is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
       Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
       Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

         1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
       source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
       conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
       copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
       notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
       and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
       along with the Program.

       You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
       you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

         2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
       of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
       distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
       above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

           a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
           stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

           b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
           whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
           part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
           parties under the terms of this License.

           c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
           when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
           interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
           announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
           notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
           a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
           these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
           License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
           does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
           the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

       These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
       identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
       and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
       themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
       sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
       distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
       on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
       this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
       entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

       Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
       your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
       exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
       collective works based on the Program.

       In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
       with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
       a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
       the scope of this License.

         3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
       under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
       Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

           a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
           source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
           1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

           b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
           years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
           cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
           machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
           distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
           customarily used for software interchange; or,

           c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
           to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
           allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
           received the program in object code or executable form with such
           an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

       The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
       making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
       code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
       associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
       control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
       special exception, the source code distributed need not include
       anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
       form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
       operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
       itself accompanies the executable.

       If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
       access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
       access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
       distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
       compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

         4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
       except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
       otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
       void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
       However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
       this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
       parties remain in full compliance.

         5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
       signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
       distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
       prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
       modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
       Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
       all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
       the Program or works based on it.

         6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
       Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
       original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
       these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
       restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
       You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
       this License.

         7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
       infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
       conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
       otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
       excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
       distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
       License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
       may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
       license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
       all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
       the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
       refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

       If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
       any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
       apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
       circumstances.

       It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
       patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
       such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
       integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
       implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
       generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
       through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
       system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
       to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
       impose that choice.

       This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
       be a consequence of the rest of this License.

         8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
       certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
       original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
       may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
       those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
       countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
       the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

         9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
       of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
       be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
       address new problems or concerns.

       Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
       specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
       later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
       either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
       Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
       this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
       Foundation.

         10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
       programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
       to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
       Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
       make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
       of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
       of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                                   NO WARRANTY

         11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
       FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
       OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
       PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
       OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
       MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
       TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
       PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
       REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

         12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
       WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
       REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
       INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
       OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
       TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
       YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
       PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
       POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                            END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                   How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

         If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
       possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
       free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

         To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
       to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
       convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
       the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

           <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
           Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

           This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
           it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
           the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
           (at your option) any later version.

           This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
           but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
           MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
           GNU General Public License for more details.

           You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
           with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
           51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.

       Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

       If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
       when it starts in an interactive mode:

           Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
           Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
           This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
           under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

       The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
       parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
       be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
       mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

       You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
       school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
       necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

         Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
         `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

         <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
         Ty Coon, President of Vice

       This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
       proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
       consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
       library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
       Public License instead of this License.

                           GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                              Version 2, June 1991

        Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
        51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
        Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
        of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                                   Preamble

         The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
       freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
       License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
       software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
       General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
       Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
       using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
       the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
       your programs, too.

         When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
       price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
       have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
       this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
       if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
       in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

         To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
       anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
       These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
       distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

         For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
       gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
       you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
       source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
       rights.

         We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
       (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
       distribute and/or modify the software.

         Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
       that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
       software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
       want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
       that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
       authors' reputations.

         Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
       patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
       program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
       program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
       patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

         The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
       modification follow.

                           GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
          TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

         0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
       a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
       under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
       refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
       means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
       that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
       either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
       language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
       the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

       Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
       covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
       running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
       is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
       Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
       Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

         1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
       source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
       conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
       copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
       notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
       and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
       along with the Program.

       You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
       you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

         2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
       of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
       distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
       above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

           a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
           stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

           b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
           whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
           part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
           parties under the terms of this License.

           c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
           when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
           interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
           announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
           notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
           a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
           these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
           License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
           does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
           the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

       These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
       identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
       and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
       themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
       sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
       distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
       on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
       this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
       entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

       Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
       your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
       exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
       collective works based on the Program.

       In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
       with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
       a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
       the scope of this License.

         3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
       under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
       Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

           a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
           source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
           1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

           b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
           years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
           cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
           machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
           distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
           customarily used for software interchange; or,

           c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
           to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
           allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
           received the program in object code or executable form with such
           an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

       The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
       making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
       code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
       associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
       control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
       special exception, the source code distributed need not include
       anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
       form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
       operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
       itself accompanies the executable.

       If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
       access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
       access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
       distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
       compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

         4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
       except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
       otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
       void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
       However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
       this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
       parties remain in full compliance.

         5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
       signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
       distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
       prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
       modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
       Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
       all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
       the Program or works based on it.

         6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
       Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
       original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
       these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
       restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
       You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
       this License.

         7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
       infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
       conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
       otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
       excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
       distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
       License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
       may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
       license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
       all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
       the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
       refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

       If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
       any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
       apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
       circumstances.

       It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
       patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
       such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
       integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
       implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
       generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
       through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
       system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
       to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
       impose that choice.

       This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
       be a consequence of the rest of this License.

         8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
       certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
       original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
       may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
       those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
       countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
       the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

         9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
       of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
       be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
       address new problems or concerns.

       Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
       specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
       later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
       either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
       Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
       this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
       Foundation.

         10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
       programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
       to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
       Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
       make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
       of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
       of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                                   NO WARRANTY

         11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
       FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
       OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
       PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
       OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
       MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
       TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
       PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
       REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

         12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
       WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
       REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
       INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
       OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
       TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
       YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
       PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
       POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                            END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                   How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

         If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
       possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
       free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

         To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
       to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
       convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
       the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

           <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
           Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

           This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
           it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
           the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
           (at your option) any later version.

           This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
           but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
           MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
           GNU General Public License for more details.

           You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
           with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
           51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.

       Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

       If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
       when it starts in an interactive mode:

           Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
           Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
           This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
           under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

       The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
       parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
       be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
       mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

       You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
       school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
       necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

         Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
         `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

         <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
         Ty Coon, President of Vice

       This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
       proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
       consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
       library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
       Public License instead of this License.

        Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

        Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
        of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

       [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
        as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
        the version number 2.1.]

                                   Preamble

         The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
       freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
       Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
       free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

         This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
       specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
       Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
       can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
       this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
       strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

         When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
       not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
       you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
       for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
       it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
       it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
       these things.

         To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
       distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
       rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
       you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

         For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
       or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
       you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
       code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
       complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
       with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
       it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

         We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
       library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
       permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

         To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
       there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
       modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
       that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
       author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
       introduced by others.
       
         Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
       any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
       effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
       restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
       any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
       consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

         Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
       ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
       General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
       is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
       this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
       libraries into non-free programs.

         When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
       a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
       combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
       General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
       entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
       Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
       the library.

         We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
       does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
       Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
       of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
       are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
       libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
       special circumstances.

         For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
       encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
       a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
       allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
       library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
       case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
       software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

         In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
       programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
       free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
       non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
       operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
       system.

         Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
       users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
       linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
       that program using a modified version of the Library.

         The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
       modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
       "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
       former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
       be combined with the library in order to run.
       
                         GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
          TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

         0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
       program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
       other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
       this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
       Each licensee is addressed as "you".

         A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
       prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
       (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

         The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
       which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
       Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
       copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
       portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
       straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
       included without limitation in the term "modification".)

         "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
       making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
       all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
       interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
       and installation of the library.

         Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
       covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
       running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
       such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
       on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
       writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
       and what the program that uses the Library does.

         1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
       complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
       you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
       appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
       all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
       warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
       Library.

         You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
       and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
       fee.
       
         2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
       of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
       distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
       above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

           a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

           b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
           stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

           c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
           charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

           d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
           table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
           the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
           is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
           in the event an application does not supply such function or
           table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
           its purpose remains meaningful.

           (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
           a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
           application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
           application-supplied function or table used by this function must
           be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
           root function must still compute square roots.)

       These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
       identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
       and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
       themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
       sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
       distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
       on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
       this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
       entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
       it.

       Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
       your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
       exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
       collective works based on the Library.

       In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
       with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
       a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
       the scope of this License.

         3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
       License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
       this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
       that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
       instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
       ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
       that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
       these notices.
       
         Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
       that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
       subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

         This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
       the Library into a program that is not a library.

         4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
       derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
       under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
       it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
       must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
       medium customarily used for software interchange.

         If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
       from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
       source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
       distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
       compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

         5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
       Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
       linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
       work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
       therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

         However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
       creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
       contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
       library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
       Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

         When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
       that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
       derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
       Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
       linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
       threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

         If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
       structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
       functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
       file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
       work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
       Library will still fall under Section 6.)

         Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
       distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
       Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
       whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
       
         6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
       link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
       work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
       under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
       modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
       engineering for debugging such modifications.

         You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
       Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
       this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
       during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
       copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
       directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
       of these things:

           a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
           machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
           changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
           Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
           with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
           uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
           user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
           executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
           that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
           Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
           to use the modified definitions.)

           b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
           Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
           copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
           rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
           will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
           the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
           interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

           c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
           least three years, to give the same user the materials
           specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
           than the cost of performing this distribution.

           d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
           from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
           specified materials from the same place.

           e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
           materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

         For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
       Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
       reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
       the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
       normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
       components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
       which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
       the executable.

         It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
       restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
       accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
       use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
       distribute.
       
         7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
       Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
       facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
       library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
       the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
       permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

           a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
           based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
           facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
           Sections above.

           b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
           that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
           where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

         8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
       the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
       attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
       distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
       rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
       or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
       terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

         9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
       signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
       distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
       prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
       modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
       Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
       all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
       the Library or works based on it.

         10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
       Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
       original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
       subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
       restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
       You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
       this License.
       
         11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
       infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
       conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
       otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
       excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
       distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
       License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
       may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
       license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
       all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
       the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
       refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

       If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
       particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
       and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

       It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
       patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
       such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
       integrity of the free software distribution system which is
       implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
       generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
       through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
       system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
       to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
       impose that choice.

       This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
       be a consequence of the rest of this License.

         12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
       certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
       original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
       an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
       so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
       excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
       written in the body of this License.

         13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
       versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
       Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
       but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

       Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
       specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
       "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
       conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
       the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
       license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
       the Free Software Foundation.
       
         14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
       programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
       write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
       copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
       Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
       decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
       of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
       and reuse of software generally.

                                   NO WARRANTY

         15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
       WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
       EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
       OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
       KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
       IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
       PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
       LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
       THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

         16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
       WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
       AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
       FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
       CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
       LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
       RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
       FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
       SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
       DAMAGES.

                            END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
       
                  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

         If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
       possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
       everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
       redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
       ordinary General Public License).

         To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
       safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
       convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
       "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

           <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
           Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

           This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
           modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
           License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
           version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

           This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
           but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
           MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
           Lesser General Public License for more details.

           You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
           License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
           Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

       Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

       You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
       school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
       necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

         Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
         library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

         <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
         Ty Coon, President of Vice

       That's all there is to it!

       		   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                              Version 3, 29 June 2007

        Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
        Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
        of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


         This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
       the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
       License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

         0. Additional Definitions.

         As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
       General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
       General Public License.

         "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
       other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

         An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
       by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
       Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
       of using an interface provided by the Library.

         A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
       Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
       with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
       Version".

         The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
       Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
       for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
       based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

         The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
       object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
       and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
       Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

         1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

         You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
       without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

         2. Conveying Modified Versions.

         If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
       facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
       that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
       facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
       version:

          a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
          ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
          function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
          whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

          b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
          this License applicable to that copy.

         3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

         The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
       a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
       code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
       material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
       layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
       (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

          a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
          Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
          covered by this License.

          b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
          document.

         4. Combined Works.

         You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
       taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
       portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
       engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
       the following:

          a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
          the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
          covered by this License.

          b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
          document.

          c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
          execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
          these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
          copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

          d) Do one of the following:

              0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
              License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
              suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
              recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
              the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
              manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
              Corresponding Source.

              1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
              Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
              a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
              system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
              of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
              Version.

          e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
          be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
          GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
          necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
          Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
          Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
          you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
          the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
          Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
          Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
          for conveying Corresponding Source.)

         5. Combined Libraries.

         You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
       Library side by side in a single library together with other library
       facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
       License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
       choice, if you do both of the following:

          a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
          on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
          conveyed under the terms of this License.

          b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
          is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
          accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

         6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

         The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
       of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
       versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
       differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

         Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the

        Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

                           675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA

        Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies

        of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.



       [This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is

        numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]



       			    Preamble



         The licenses for most software are designed to take away your

       freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public

       Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change

       free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.



         This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some

       specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any

       other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for

       your libraries, too.



         When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not

       price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you

       have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for

       this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it

       if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it

       in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.



         To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid

       anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.

       These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if

       you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.



         For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis

       or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave

       you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source

       code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide

       complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them

       with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling

       it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.



         Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright

       the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal

       permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.



         Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain

       that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free

       library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we

       want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original

       version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on

       the original authors' reputations.

       

         Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software

       patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free

       software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect

       transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,

       we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's

       free use or not licensed at all.



         Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary

       GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This

       license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain

       designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary

       one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is

       the same as in the ordinary license.



         The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that

       they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a

       program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without

       changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is

       analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in

       a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a

       derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License

       treats it as such.



         Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General

       Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software

       sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We

       concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.



         However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the

       users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the

       libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to

       permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while

       preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free

       libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve

       this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards

       changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this

       will lead to faster development of free libraries.



         The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and

       modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a

       "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The

       former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only

       works together with the library.



         Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary

       General Public License rather than by this special one.

       

       		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

          TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION



         0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which

       contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized

       party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library

       General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is

       addressed as "you".



         A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data

       prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs

       (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.



         The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work

       which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the

       Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under

       copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a

       portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated

       straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is

       included without limitation in the term "modification".)



         "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for

       making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means

       all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated

       interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation

       and installation of the library.



         Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not

       covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of

       running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from

       such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based

       on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for

       writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does

       and what the program that uses the Library does.

         

         1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's

       complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that

       you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an

       appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact

       all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any

       warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the

       Library.



         You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,

       and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a

       fee.

       

         2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion

       of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and

       distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1

       above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:



           a) The modified work must itself be a software library.



           b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices

           stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.



           c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no

           charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.



           d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a

           table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses

           the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility

           is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,

           in the event an application does not supply such function or

           table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of

           its purpose remains meaningful.



           (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has

           a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the

           application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any

           application-supplied function or table used by this function must

           be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square

           root function must still compute square roots.)



       These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If

       identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,

       and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in

       themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those

       sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you

       distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based

       on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of

       this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the

       entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote

       it.



       Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest

       your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to

       exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or

       collective works based on the Library.



       In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library

       with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of

       a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under

       the scope of this License.



         3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public

       License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do

       this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so

       that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,

       instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the

       ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify

       that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in

       these notices.

       

         Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for

       that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all

       subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.



         This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of

       the Library into a program that is not a library.



         4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or

       derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form

       under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany

       it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which

       must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a

       medium customarily used for software interchange.



         If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy

       from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the

       source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to

       distribute the source code, even though third parties are not

       compelled to copy the source along with the object code.



         5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the

       Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or

       linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a

       work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and

       therefore falls outside the scope of this License.



         However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library

       creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it

       contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the

       library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.

       Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.



         When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file

       that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a

       derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.

       Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be

       linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The

       threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.



         If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data

       structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline

       functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object

       file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative

       work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the

       Library will still fall under Section 6.)



         Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may

       distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.

       Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,

       whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

       

         6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or

       link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a

       work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work

       under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit

       modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse

       engineering for debugging such modifications.



         You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the

       Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by

       this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work

       during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the

       copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference

       directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one

       of these things:



           a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding

           machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever

           changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under

           Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked

           with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that

           uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the

           user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified

           executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood

           that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the

           Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application

           to use the modified definitions.)



           b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at

           least three years, to give the same user the materials

           specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more

           than the cost of performing this distribution.



           c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy

           from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above

           specified materials from the same place.



           d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these

           materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.



         For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the

       Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for

       reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,

       the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally

       distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major

       components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on

       which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies

       the executable.



         It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license

       restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally

       accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot

       use both them and the Library together in an executable that you

       distribute.

       

         7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the

       Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library

       facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined

       library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on

       the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise

       permitted, and provided that you do these two things:



           a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work

           based on the Library, uncombined with any other library

           facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the

           Sections above.



           b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact

           that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining

           where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.



         8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute

       the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any

       attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or

       distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your

       rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,

       or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses

       terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.



         9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not

       signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or

       distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are

       prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by

       modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the

       Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and

       all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying

       the Library or works based on it.



         10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the

       Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the

       original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library

       subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further

       restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.

       You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to

       this License.

       

         11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent

       infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),

       conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or

       otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not

       excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot

       distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this

       License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you

       may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent

       license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by

       all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then

       the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to

       refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.



       If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any

       particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,

       and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.



       It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any

       patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any

       such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the

       integrity of the free software distribution system which is

       implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made

       generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed

       through that system in reliance on consistent application of that

       system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing

       to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot

       impose that choice.



       This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to

       be a consequence of the rest of this License.



         12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in

       certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the

       original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add

       an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,

       so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus

       excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if

       written in the body of this License.



         13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new

       versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.

       Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,

       but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.



       Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library

       specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and

       "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and

       conditions either of that version or of any later version published by

       the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a

       license version number, you may choose any version ever published by

       the Free Software Foundation.

       

         14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free

       programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,

       write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is

       copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free

       Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our

       decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status

       of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing

       and reuse of software generally.



       			    NO WARRANTY



         15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO

       WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

       EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR

       OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY

       KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE

       IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR

       PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE

       LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME

       THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.



         16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN

       WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY

       AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU

       FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR

       CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE

       LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING

       RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A

       FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF

       SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

       DAMAGES.



       		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

       

            Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries



         If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest

       possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that

       everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting

       redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the

       ordinary General Public License).



         To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is

       safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively

       convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the

       "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.



           <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>

           Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>



           This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or

           modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public

           License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either

           version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.



           This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,

           but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

           MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU

           Library General Public License for more details.



           You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public

           License along with this library; if not, write to the Free

           Software Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.



       Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.



       You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your

       school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if

       necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:



         Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the

         library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.



         <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990

         Ty Coon, President of Vice



       That's all there is to it!

-------------------- SECTION 1: GNU Lesser General Public License, V2.1 --------------------

		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2.1, February 1999

 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
    Lesser General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

That's all there is to it!



-------------------- SECTION 2: GNU General Public License, V2.0 --------------------

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.



-------------------- SECTION 3: GNU Lesser General Public License, V3.0 --------------------

		   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

  0. Additional Definitions.

  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.

  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.

  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
Version".

  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying Modified Versions.

  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:

   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
   this License applicable to that copy.

  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

  4. Combined Works.

  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

   d) Do one of the following:

       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
       Corresponding Source.

       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
       Version.

   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)

  5. Combined Libraries.

  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:

   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
   conveyed under the terms of this License.

   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.


-------------------- SECTION 4: GNU Library General Public License, V2.0 --------------------

		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
 numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
your libraries, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
the original authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
free use or not licensed at all.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This
license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary
one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is
the same as in the ordinary license.

  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without
changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in
a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License
treats it as such.

  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.

  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to
permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve
this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this
will lead to faster development of free libraries.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
works together with the library.

  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
General Public License rather than by this special one.

		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is
addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.
  
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
    version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
    Library General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

That's all there is to it!

     pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of
     the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part
     of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation,
     if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display
     generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party
     notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for
     informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You
     may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that
     You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text
     from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices
     cannot be construed as modifying the License.  You may add Your own
     copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional
     or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or

8. Limitation of Liability.
In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law
(such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing,
shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct,
indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to
use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other

of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.
While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may
choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with
this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of
any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS 

-------------------- SECTION 6: Perl Artistic License --------------------

                        The "Artistic License"

				Preamble

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make
reasonable modifications.

Definitions:

	"Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the
	Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files
	created through textual modification.

	"Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been
	modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes
	of the Copyright Holder as specified below.

	"Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or
	copyrights for the package.

	"You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing
	this Package.

	"Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the
	basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved,
	and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it to the
	Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large
	as a market that must bear the fee.)

	"Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item
	itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.
	It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it
	under the same conditions they received it.

1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you
duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package
modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided
that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and
when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the
following:

    a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
    Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or
    an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive
    site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include
    your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.

    b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

    c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
    with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide
    a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly
    documents how it differs from the Standard Version.

    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

    a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
    together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where
    to get the Standard Version.

    b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
    the Package with your modifications.

    c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly
    document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together
    with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.

    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this
Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this
Package.  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However,
you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly
commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software
distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a
product of your own.  You may embed this Package's interpreter within
an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as a mere
form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of the
interpreter is so embedded.

6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall
under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated
them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
Package.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this
Package via the so-called "undump" or "unexec" methods of producing a
binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall
neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it
fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do
not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this
Package.

7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other
languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to
emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this
Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the
equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do
not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the
regression tests for the language.

8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always
permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is,
when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's interfaces visible
to the end user of the commercial distribution.  Such use shall not be
construed as a distribution of this Package.

9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.

10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
