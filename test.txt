An SQL notebook cannot be linked to multiple SQL connections.

True.
False.



 By default, Dataiku renders charts on a dataset using:

The entire dataset
The same sample used in the Explore tab
A random sample of 100,000 rows
The first 100,000 rows



An SQL notebook writes a query output as a new dataset in your SQL database.

False. You need a recipe to create an output in the Flow.
True. Every SQL query in a notebook creates an output in the Flow.




When you run an SQL query, Dataiku handles these tasks, EXCEPT for:

Specification of the storage location for the output dataset
Table creation and deletion
Detection of the table schema
Insertion into the output table




Dataiku can leverage the SQL computation engine in all but one of these cases.

Execute a visual recipe
Render charts
Train a deep learning model
Execute a SQL-based code recipe



If a database connection has been set up in Dataiku, you can import data into Dataiku directly from the database without having to sync or prepare tables.

True
False




An SQL query requires a primary SELECT statement that Dataiku can use to write the final INSERT INTO a table.

True.
False.





SQL datasets in Dataiku are pointers to database tables. That is, the datasets are present in your SQL database, but are not duplicated in Dataiku.

False. The datasets are present both in your SQL database and in Dataiku.
True. The datasets are present only in your SQL database.




When writing data to your SQL database, Dataiku prompts you to write a “CREATE TABLE” query.

False
True



The output of an SQL script can be stored using a different database connection than the input.

False. This option is available for the SQL query, but not for the SQL script.
True. You can specify a different database connection for the output data than the one used by the input data.



When creating an SQL dataset in Dataiku, the data is written in ______________.

the local DSS server only
both the local DSS server and the SQL database
the SQL database only



Which of the following cases is an acceptable use of the SQL Script? 

Both examples.
If the SQL code makes use of ‘With’ commands that cannot be re-written
None of these examples.
If the data types in a table are not natively handled by Dataiku




If you specify use of the database engine when creating charts on an SQL dataset, what portion of the dataset will be used to create the charts?

The entire dataset
The same sample used in the Explore tab
A random sample of 100,000 rows
The first 100,000 rows
