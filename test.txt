I used the learnings to enhance security features in a project I was working on.”

6. Given an array filled with random values, write a function to rotate the array by 90 degrees clockwise.
As a software engineer, understanding multidimensional arrays is important to design any system that requires oriental manipulation.

How to Answer Explain the concept of matrix rotation and the steps involved, which is usually transposing the matrix and then flipping it horizontally.

Example

“This can be done using the NumPy library in Python, which efficiently handles arrays. The function will transpose and flip the input matrix horizontally, effectively rotating it 90 degrees clockwise. It’s efficient and works well with matrices of any size.”

7. Write a program that checks if an integer is a vampire number.
Vampire numbers are a fun and interesting problem that tests understanding of number properties, iteration through possibilities, and string manipulation, which are relevant skills in many software development tasks.

How to Answer

Describe the strategy for identifying vampire numbers. It involves checking if an integer can be factored into two numbers (fangs) of equal length, where the digits of the fangs can be rearranged to form the original number.

Example

“My program would first verify that the number has an even number of digits; if not, it cannot be a vampire number. Next, it would generate all possible pairs of factors (fangs) that are each half the length of the original number. For each pair, the program checks if rearranging the digits of the two fangs can produce the original number. This involves converting the numbers to strings, sorting the digits, and then comparing the sorted string of the original number with the concatenated, sorted strings of the fangs. It’s important to iterate efficiently, only considering fang pairs that meet the criteria (e.g., excluding pairs where both fangs end in zero, as this would not lead to a valid vampire number). If any pair of fangs satisfies these conditions, the number is a vampire number.”

8. Implement the Fibonacci algorithm in three different methods: 1. recursively, 2. iteratively, and 3. using memoization.
The Fibonacci sequence is a classic problem in software engineering interviews. Canonical needs to implement scalable solutions and your approach to this problem will reveal how well you understand this.

How to Answer

Demonstrate your understanding of the trade-offs between simplicity (recursion), efficiency (iteration), and optimization (memoization). Explain how each approach can be used in different scenarios based on computational resources and execution time.

Example

“A recursive solution involves a function calling itself with a smaller subset of the problem until it reaches a base case. This method is straightforward but can lead to significant inefficiencies due to repeated calculations. The iterative approach calculates each Fibonacci number sequentially, starting from the base cases and building up to the desired number by looping from 0 to n. This method is more efficient as it doesn’t involve repeated calculations or deep call stacks. Memoization optimizes the recursive solution by storing previously calculated Fibonacci numbers in a data structure during the function’s execution. When the function is called again with the same input, it first checks if the result is in the storage to avoid recalculating, which reduces the number of computations needed.”

9. You are given an array of string tokens that represent an arithmetic expression in a Reverse Polish notation. Evaluate the expression.
Evaluating RPN expressions requires an understanding of stacks and post-order traversal logic, which are crucial for parsing expressions or developing features like calculators, compilers, or interpreters in software development.

How to Answer

Discuss using a stack to evaluate the expression. Explain how you would iterate through the tokens array, pushing numbers onto the stack until an operator is encountered.

Example

“I would use a stack to store operands. While iterating through the array of tokens, I would push any numbers I encounter onto the stack. When I come across an operator, I’d pop the two most recent numbers off the stack, apply the operator (being careful to maintain the correct order), and then push the result back onto the stack. After processing all tokens, if the expression is valid, there should be exactly one number left on the stack, which is the result of the expression.”

10. You’re given a list of sorted integers in which more than 50% of the list is comprised of the same repeating integer. Write a function to return the list’s median value.
This question tests your understanding of statistics and optimization efficiency based on a given set of conditions.

How to Answer

Mention how the presence of a majority element (more than 50% occurrence) affects the median’s location. With this information, focus on optimizing the median-finding process, highlighting that the median must be the majority element itself due to its frequency and distribution.

Example

“Given the list is sorted and contains a majority element (an element that appears more than 50% of the time), the median will always be this majority element, regardless of whether the list length is odd or even. This is because, in a sorted list, the middle element(s) that determine the median must be part of the majority element’s sequence due to its dominance. Therefore, my function would not need to inspect each element to find the median. Instead, it could directly return the value at the middle index of the list.”
